# The theme you see now is the default Jekyll theme, Minima.
More free themes can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).

When you're choosing a theme, make sure to choose one that gets regularly updated and has enough documentation to help you in case things go wonky.

# There are two ways to bring an online theme into your Jekyll sites, the quick start, and by installing a theme as a gem.
#### The Quick Start:
Fork the theme repository from GitHub (by pressing the Fork button)

**Inside your terminal:**

`git clone URLofFork`

This method is sometimes glitchy, but it can be useful if you want to see demos or don't have much time. This method creates a new site to begin working with and does not require a `Jekyll new` process.

#### Installing a theme as a gem:

This option changes the site you've already created with `Jekyll new` into the theme you prefer. There are more steps but it's more stable.

**In your terminal:**

`Install jekyll-theme-athena` or some other theme

**In your config.yml file inside your Jekyll site:**

Change the URL and BaseURL to empty `""`

*Note:* Sometimes, you'll have to find and replace your current config.yml file with the config.yml file inside the gem you installed when you ran the `install jekyll-theme-athena` command. You can find the file from the terminal: `"jekyll-theme-athena" --path`. Or, you can browse your Ruby gem files.

**In your gemfile inside your Jekyll site:**

Swap `theme: jekyll-theme-athena` for the correct theme name

While you're in your gem file, install these this plugin: `‘jekyll-compose’, group: [:jekyll_plugins]` so you'll be able to post easily from the command line.

`bundle exec jekyll post "postTitle"` is the command to post.

**Inside the terminal**

`bundle` to bundle all the new plugins and configurations

`bundle exec jekyll serve` to see your changes!

**If you want to edit the theme you've chosen you'll need to know a little HTML and CSS, and you'll need to read [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) to figure out how exactly to edit a Jekyll theme.**
